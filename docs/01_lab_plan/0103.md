# Consider the Azure services most suitable for storing data of your application

Now that you identified the viable compute platforms, you need to decide which Azure service could be used to store the applications data.

The Azure platform offers several database-as-a-services options, including [Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-database-paas-overview?view=azuresql), [Azure Database for MySQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/), [Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/introduction), and [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/). Your choice of the database technology should be based on the following requirements for the Spring Petclinic application:

* The target database service should simplify the migration path from the on-premises MySQL deployment.
* The target database service must support automatic backups.
* The target database service needs to support automatic patching.

Based on these requirements, you decided to use Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server.
