# Create additional networking resources

Since you want to place the apps in your AKS cluster behind an Azure Application Gateway, you will need to provide the additional networking resources for the Application Gateway. You can deploy all of them in the same virtual network, in which case you will need at least 1 additional subnet. You can use the following guidance to implement these changes:

- [Create a Virtual Network and default subnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/vnet?view=azure-cli-latest#az-network-vnet-create).
- [Add subnets to a Virtual Network](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet?view=azure-cli-latest).

In later exercises you will network integrate the backend services like the database and the Key Vault.

## Step by step guidance

1. From the Git Bash prompt, run the following command to create an additional subnet in your virtual network.

   ```bash
   APPLICATION_GATEWAY_SUBNET_CIDR=10.1.2.0/24
   
   APPLICATION_GATEWAY_SUBNET_NAME=app-gw-subnet
   
   az network vnet subnet create \
       --name $APPLICATION_GATEWAY_SUBNET_NAME \
       --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --vnet-name $VIRTUAL_NETWORK_NAME \
       --address-prefix $APPLICATION_GATEWAY_SUBNET_CIDR
   ```
