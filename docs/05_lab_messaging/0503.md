# Update an existing microservice to use the queues

You have now reviewed how an existing microservice interacts with the Service Bus queue. In the upcoming task, you will enable the `visits` microservice to also read messages from a queue and write messages to another queue. You can use the following guidance to implement these changes:

- [Use Java Message Service 2.0 API with Azure Service Bus Premium](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/how-to-use-java-message-service-20).
- [How to use the Spring Boot Starter for Azure Service Bus JMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-service-bus).

To start, you will need to add the necessary dependencies.

## Step by step guidance

1. From the Git Bash window, in the src directory of the java-microservices-aks-lab repository you cloned locally, use your favorite text editor to open the `spring-petclinic-microservices/spring-petclinic-visits-service/pom.xml` file of the `visits` microservice. In the `<!-- Spring Cloud -->` section, following the last dependency element, add the following dependency element:

   ```xml
           <dependency>
             <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
             <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-starter-servicebus-jms</artifactId>
           </dependency>
   ```
